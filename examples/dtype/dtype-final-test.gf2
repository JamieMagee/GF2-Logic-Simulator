/*
This circuit shows the effect of a change in the input signal
around the rising clock edge for the final version of the logic
simulator. This is slightly different to dtype-random-determinate.gf2
due to the double buffering of output signal states, which changed the
gate propagation delay. Gate type has been changed from OR to AND. 

With double-buffering, the following timings are always true:
AND rising edge delayed by 1, falling edge delayed by 2
OR  rising edge delayed by 2, falling edge delayed by 1
